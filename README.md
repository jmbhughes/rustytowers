# rustytowers

This is my game started during the [Bevy Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3). I'm hoping to finish a prototype during the jam, but we'll see. 

It's a tower defense game with the catch that placing a tower damages all the neighboring towers (and enemies) depending on their distance. That's the main side effect to match the jam theme.

## How to play
Right now it's very much under construction, but if you'd like to prototype it download the repo and run `cargo run --release`. Eventually, I plan to release a version on itch.io for fellow jammers to play and rate.
