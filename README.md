# rustytowers

This is my game for the [Bevy Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3). [Play it on itch.io!](https://jmbhughes.itch.io/rusty-towers)

It's a tower defense game with the catch that placing a tower damages all the neighboring towers (and enemies) depending on their distance. You get a chance to heal them later but be careful that spawns more enemies.
